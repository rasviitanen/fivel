# Fivel
This project builds upon the SEMAT Essence standard, credit goes to SEMAT Inc. for the original creation. See their user guide [here](http://semat.org/essence-user-guide).

### Essence
Essence helps teams to:

* Understand where they are
* Understand what needs to be addressed
* Track progress and health
* Keep projects in balance and avoid catastrophic failures
* Form good sprint goals and other objectives
* Form teams
* Define practice independent checkpoints, milestones and lifecycles.
